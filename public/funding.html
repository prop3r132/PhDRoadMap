    </ul>

    <h4>2. Top-Tier Research Universities</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Stanford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Carnegie Mellon University</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Considerations</h3>

        <li><strong>Research specific departments and programs:</strong> While the overall university reputation is important, funding opportunities can vary significantly between departments and programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Explore funding options:</strong> Familiarize yourself with different types of financial aid, such as scholarships, fellowships, teaching assistantships, and research assistantships.</li>
        <li><strong>Network with current students:</strong> Connect with current PhD students at your target universities to gain insights into the funding landscape and application process.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider cost of living:</strong> While full funding can cover tuition and fees, living expenses vary widely between locations.</li>
    </ul>
